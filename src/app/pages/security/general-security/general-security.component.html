                While working with APIs, it's very important to observe certain security measures to avoid having your
                account being compromised.
            </p>
            <p class="page-description text-black-5">
                To this end, itâ€™s important to establish guidelines to be followed when integrating Reloadly's APIs to
                your
                product or application. This guide will be helpful to security engineers, solution architects, product
                managers, and anyone integrating APIs in general as its directives span across different applications
                and
                use cases.

                    Consider forming an ITSM (IT Security Management) team to formulate IT security policies, assess
                    security vulnerabilities periodically and enforce security policies.

                    Be aware of the IT security requirements imposed by those parties with whom you integrate.

                <li number="4">
                    Before you go live with your product and integrations with others (e.g. Reloadly) review all
                    security measures that you have taken to bullet-proof your software.

                <li number="5">
                    Enforce strong security best practices such as 2FA, regular password resets, etc, on your own

                    Promote and encourage a strong culture around security in design and code. Security is not an
                    after-thought, it needs to be baked into software design from the get-go.
                </li>
                <li number="2">
                    Ensure that production security credentials like passwords, clientID, clientsecret, etc. are never
                    checked in into version control.

                    Have your engineering team review code with your ITSM team to certify that all security policies
                    mandated by the organization are fully implemented.
                </li>
                <li number="5">
                    Ensure that sensitive information such as passwords etc. is never stored in databases or files in
                    clear-text format; they should be always encrypted with strong and industry-standard encryption.
                </li>
                <li number="6">
                    Ensure that developer machines and servers are always patched with the latest security patches

                </li>
                <li number="7">
                    Be aware of social engineering and other phishing threats.

                    Ensure and demand from third-party integrators that end-to-end encryption via the latest standards
                    of SSL/TLS is used.

                <li number="9">
                    If you integrate with Reloadly APIs via server-side, ensure that your security credentials like
                    ClientID and ClientSecret are not printed to server logs. Your production servers should be fully
                    secure and locked down for any unauthorized access.

                <li number="10">
                    If you integrate with Reloadly APIs via SDK, ensure that you have robust processes in place to
                    manage the production clientID and clientSecret that you package in your mobile apps. Consult the
                    relevant documents and best practices applicable for the platform you are developing for, e.g. iOS,
                    Android.

                    Ensure that you create your production Developer Portal user ID using a dedicated company email ID
                    that's registered with your company domain. Don't use email addresses from popular email services
                    like Gmail or Yahoo to create your production user ID in the Reloadly developer portal.

                    Handover your Developer Portal production credentials to the right team or authorized person
                    managing IT production systems for your company. You should never share passwords with anyone, not
                    even Reloadly. Change your Developer Portal password for production access regularly, typically
                    every 90 days or less.
                </li>
                <li number="3">
                    Ensure that you set up 2FA on your Developer Portal account. The mobile device used, should belong
                    to a designated and authorized individual/team in charge of production systems at your company.
                </li>
                <li number="4">
                    Ensure that ClientID and Clientsecret that you generate in Developer Portal which are used in your
                    production systems are not accessible to any unauthorized person. If you have reasons to believe
                    that your ClientID and ClientSecret have been compromised, please rotate them using the Reloadly
                    Developer portal immediately.

                <li number="5">
                    As a best practice, consider rotating your ClientID and ClientSecret every 90 days or less.

                    Do not share your Bearer Tokens with anyone. If you believe that your Bearer Token has been

                    For server-side integration, share your production server IP addresses with Reloadly so that they
                    will be whitelisted by Reloadly. When you whitelist your production server IP addresses, it ensures
                    that traffic from only those servers will be accepted by Reloadly. If your servers are in a public
                    cloud like AWS or GCP, do consult your cloud provider as to how you can ensure stable IP addresses
                    for your production servers. You may also consider routing your traffic through proxy servers with
                    stable IP addresses.

                <li number="8">
                    For integration with Reloadly via mobile SDKs, consider 2FA in your mobile apps like OTP, etc. Don't
                    just rely on simple user/password-based authentication.
